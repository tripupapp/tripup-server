## Build Instructions

### Dependencies
- Go 1.11.5
- Neo4j 3.3.2
- Firebase, for authentication.
- AWS, for data storage.
- OneSignal, for notifications.

*Note: where possible, analytics are disabled for the above services.*

### Steps
1. Build the server binary by running the following commands:
    ```bash
    > go version
    go version go1.11.5 darwin/amd64
    > cd /path/to/server-code && go get -u
    > cd /path/to/server-code && env GO111MODULE=on go build
    ```
2. Set the environment variables as appropriate for your shell. Example for `bash`:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    > export TRIPUP_NEO_USER="NEO4J_USERNAME"                         # "neo4j"
    > export TRIPUP_NEO_PASS="NEO4J_PASSWORD"                         # "neo4j"
    > export TRIPUP_NEO_HOST="NEO4J_INSTANCE_HOSTNAME"                # "localhost"
    > export TRIPUP_NEO_PORT="NEO4J_INSTANCE_BOLT_PORT"               # "7687"
    > export TRIPUP_SERVER_PORT="SERVER_INCOMING_PORT"                # "8080"
    > export TRIPUP_SERVER_TIMEOUT="SECONDS_TO_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT"    # "10s"
    > export TRIPUP_SERVER_MAX_REQ="MAX_NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS"           # "10"
    > export AWS_REGION="AWS_BUCKET_REGION"                           # "eu-west-2"
    > export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
    > export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    > export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/google-service-account-key.json"
    > export ONESIGNAL_APPID="ONESIGNAL_APPID"
    > export ONESIGNAL_APIKEY="ONESIGNAL_APIKEY"
    ```
    See https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk for instructions on how to obtain your Google Service Account JSON key.

3. With the environment variables set, run the binary in the same session:
    ```bash
    > ./appserver
    [INFO] ServerLog: 2021/05/26 21:12:27 server initialised successfully, listening on port 8080
    ```

## Usage instructions
- This server follows REST style.
- All end points are protected and require a valid JWT token. Therefore, authorisation via the auth provider (currently Firebase) is required in order to obtain a valid Authorization Bearer token.
- All user data is end-to-end encrypted, so even after authorisation, data returned will be in PGP encrypted format. The users private key(s) will be required to derive the actual data.

### API endpoints
‚ö†Ô∏è API is subject to change and there are no guarantees regarding backward compatibility for the moment.
